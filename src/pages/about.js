            Each client has different needs. That’s why our initial consultation is so important. 
            It is a chance for us to get to know one another and for you to share a bit with me about where you are financially and where you hope to end up.

            If all you needed to be successful was information, the internet is full of that. 
            You need a guide, a comfort, a support, a person to push you into being your best self - and that includes your financial behavior.

            Being in debt can make it feel like you’re drowning, heavy, stressed.  Nothing about those emotions brings joy. 
            The process of getting out of debt often has the reputation of being intense and sacrificial with no fun built in. 
            But any of us who have walked that journey before you knows that the process is not an either/or situation. 
            Dumping debt can absolutely be hard work - AND fun - AND freeing. 
            Coaching helps you identify your priorities and plan for them so that you are renewed regularly enough that you can run the entire race all the way through to the point of needing new goals because you’ve accomplished climbing the hill that once seemed too big to conquer.
